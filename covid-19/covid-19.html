    <p><b>Pakistan eases Covid-19 curbs for inbound passengers</b><br/>Pre-boarding negative PCR requirement has been abolished for fully vaccinated inbound travellers.</p>
    <p><b>ISLAMABAD: In a revised health protocol and travel advisory, Pakistan has abolished the requirement of a negative PCR test for all fully vaccinated, inbound passengers.</b>
      The decision taken by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) while reviewing the coronavirus situation across the country on Wednesday will be implemented from Thursday (today).    
      According to an NCOC statement, pre-boarding negative PCR requirement has been abolished for fully vaccinated inbound travellers. However, non-vaccinated individuals over 12 years of age will require a valid pre-boarding negative PCR test to travel to the country. The validity of a 72-hour period will be calculated from the time the sample had been collected by laboratory.    
      However, the NCOC stated that complete vaccination would be mandatory for all inbound passengers, except children below 12 years of age. Passengers aged between 12 and 18 years would be allowed to travel without the mandatory vaccination till March 31 only.</p>
